    "If the range of a feature is large, it's often a good idea to choose a small weight parameter to diminish its large effect on the estimation and cost. Visually, this would make the cost function quite skinny in a particaluar axis (the feature with a large range) and would benefit from scaling. Rescaling features involves a transformation to alter the range of the feature, which helps GD find a much clearer path to the minimum.\n",

    "Ex: $min \\leq x^{(i)} \\leq max$\n",
    "\n",
    "- normalization (divide by max)\n",
    "- mean normalization (center around zero), $x^{(i)} = \\frac{x^{(i)} - \\mu_(i)}{max-min}$\n",
    "- z-score normalization, places it inside a normal distribution. $x^{(i)} = \\frac{x^{(i)} - \\mu_{(i)}}{\\sigma_{(i)}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule of thumb is to have the range of features land around $[-1, 1]$, although there's no harm in rescaling. Note, it'd also beneficial to have each feature centered about the same point; zero in the cases for the mean normalization and z-score methods.\n",

    "If a set of features combine to create a (potentially) more representative correlation to a particular pattern of outputs, there's often a benefit to create a new feature as the combination/transfomation of the set.\n",

    "Say for example you have 2 features for predicting house value, frontage & depth. It will likely benefit the model to include a third feature for land area = frontage * depth."
